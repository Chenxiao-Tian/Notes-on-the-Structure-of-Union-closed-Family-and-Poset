# Notes-on-the-Structure-of-Union-closed-Family-and-Poset(In Preparation)
  A finite family F is union-closed if and only if for any A, B ∈ F implies A ∪ B ∈ F. The Families defined like this are
well-known for the union-closed conjecture. In this notes, we aim to analysis the structure of union-closed family more clearly. We mainly discuss the structure of
Union-closed family based on definitions and
viewpoints like minimal element, maximal element, acyclic
digraph in part II, III, IV. One of the results in this note is that
we proof that an union-closed family is always built up by a
fixed recurrence relation and several initial sets given at first
(Therom3.1). In part III, we also analyzed the structure of more general
partially ordered set based on the method and definition used before.
